# Codefolio

Codefolio is a basic portfolio renderer for your git projects. It is reliant on just 3 items:

1. A projects.json, which contains a list of git repos
2. A headline section for each project. By default, this will be the first `#` headline and the text within it. This can also be configured per project to be a different file.
3. A headline image for each project. By default this will be the first image in the project's README. Again, this can be configured per project.
